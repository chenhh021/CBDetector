    * Return the k nearest neighbor documents as determined by comparison of their vector values for
-   * this field, to the given vector, by the field's search strategy. If the search strategy is
-   * reversed, lower values indicate nearer vectors, otherwise higher scores indicate nearer
-   * vectors. Unlike relevance scores, vector scores may be negative.
+   * this field, to the given vector, by the field's similarity function. The score of each document
+   * is derived from the vector similarity in a way that ensures scores are positive and that a
+   * larger score corresponds to a higher ranking.
+   *
+   * <p>The search is allowed to be approximate, meaning the results are not guaranteed to be the
+   * true k closest neighbors. For large values of k (for example when k is close to the total
+   * number of documents), the search may also retrieve fewer than k documents.
    *
    * @param field the vector field to search
    * @param target the vector-valued query
